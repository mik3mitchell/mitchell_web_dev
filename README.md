# Mitchell Web Dev

This is my first portfolio website for http://mitchellwebdev.com.  

### Motivation

I built Mitchell Web Dev to serve as my online portfolio and allow potential employers to view my skills and resume.  After release my intention was to fix some of the issues, but I have since started an entirely new protfolio site.  

### Languages / Frameworks

**Built with:**
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap 3.3.7
* TypeIt
* Font Awesome 5
* Google Fonts

### Issues

The social banner under the hero image is not fully responsive, and misaligns on smaller devices.  This site needs to be upgraded to use CSS Grid instead of Bootstrap.
